I chose lpu due to its campus and placement services it provides. Moreover it has a wide diversity. So it provides me the opportunity to interact students 
coming from different states and different countries. 

Also it provides a great platform for extra curricular activities such as sports and dancing and may more. 
So all these attracted me towards lpu

When you join LPU you'll join a platform that hundreds of student have already used to build shining careers for themselves internationally. 
Its no wonder that LPU holds the record for highest placement from a single university in a single day not once but two years running.
